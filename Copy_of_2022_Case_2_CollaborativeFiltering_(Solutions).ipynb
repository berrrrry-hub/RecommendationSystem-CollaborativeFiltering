        "## Introduction\n",
        "One very common problem to solve is when you have a number of users and a number of products, and you want to recommend which products are most likely to be useful for which users. There are many variations of this: for example, recommending movies (such as on Netflix), figuring out what to highlight for a user on a home page, deciding what stories to show in a social media feed, and so forth. There is a general solution to this problem, called *collaborative filtering*, which works like this: look at what products the current user has used or liked, find other users that have used or liked similar products, and then recommend other products that those users have used or liked.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, on Netflix you may have watched lots of movies that are science fiction, full of action, and were made in the 1970s. Netflix may not know these particular properties of the films you have watched, but it will be able to see that other people that have watched the same movies that you watched also tended to watch other movies that are science fiction, full of action, and were made in the 1970s. In other words, to use this approach we don't necessarily need to know anything about the movies, except who like to watch them.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is actually a more general class of problems that this approach can solve, not necessarily involving users and products. Indeed, for collaborative filtering we more commonly refer to *items*, rather than *products*. Items could be links that people click on, diagnoses that are selected for patients, and so forth.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key foundational idea is that of *latent factors*. In the Netflix example, we started with the assumption that you like old, action-packed sci-fi movies. But you never actually told Netflix that you like these kinds of movies. And Netflix never actually needed to add columns to its movies table saying which movies are of these types. Still, there must be some underlying concept of sci-fi, action, and movie age, and these concepts must be relevant for at least some people's movie watching decisions.\n",

        "In this case, we'll build an explicit feedback recommender system: that is, a model that takes into account explicit feedback signals (like ratings) to recommend new content. We'll use an approach first made popular by the [Netflix prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) contest: [matrix factorization](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Recommender-Systems-[Netflix].pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea is very simple:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Start with user-item-rating triplets, conveying the information that user _i_ gave some item _j_ rating _r_.\n",
        "2. Represent both users and items as high-dimensional vectors of numbers. For example, a user could be represented by `[0.3, -1.2, 0.5]` and an item by `[1.0, -0.3, -0.6]`.\n",
        "3. The representations should be chosen so that, when we multiplied together (via [dot products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)), we can recover the original ratings.\n",
        "4. The utility of the model then is derived from the fact that if we multiply the user vector of a user with the item vector of some item they _have not_ rated, we hope to obtain a predicition for the rating they would have given to it had they seen it.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
